/*
 * Create the function fizzBuzz that takes a single integer as an argument.
 * Return 'fizz' if num is divisible by 3 with no remainder.
 * Return 'buzz' if num is divisible by 5 with no remainder.
 * Return 'fizzbuzz' if num is divisible by both 3 and 5 with no remainder.
 * If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5 then return the number given as the argument.
 * Before you write your function write automated tests to test this function.
 * The main focus of this challenge is the testing aspect of it.
